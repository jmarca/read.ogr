read.ogr
========

helper stuff to read geom tables from a db using readOGR in R

Also, coincidentally, my first "proper" R package, using devtools helper scripts

Also, coincidentally, probably a giant security hole in that I am
trusting sql string.  So don't deploy this behind a public interface
like a website.
